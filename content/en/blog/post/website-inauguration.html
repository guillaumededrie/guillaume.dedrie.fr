<h3>Finally !</h3>
<p>Let's go ! My personnal website is available. With a lot of work for the layout, multiples settings for the deployement, it's finally on the internet !</p>

<h3>What's inside ?</h3>
<p>There is my professional informations (like my Résumé) but my tech-blog too. I will talk about Open source and Free software and web and software developments, but also about my hobbies too (like subjects for French Certified First Responder volunteers).<p>

<h3>And for its updating ?</h3>
<p>I will try to update regularly my Résumé or my projects page. For the tech-blog, maybe i will try to add one article per week.</p>

<h3>Posts will be written in french or english ?</h3>
<p>Both i think ! If it's possible. French is my main language, so i will release the article in French first and then in English ... Be patient !</p>
